At The Amara, coffee is far more than just a beverage to kickstart your day. For us, it represents a continuous journey – a relentless pursuit of research, refinement, and the elevation of standards. We believe this dedication shouldn't come at an exorbitant cost. That's why we're committed to offering exceptional coffee at a fair price, while striving to positively impact our local community and the burgeoning micro-roastery scene here in Cambodia.

## Rooted in Cambodia, Crafted with Care

Coffee culture is deeply ingrained in Cambodia, and it's rapidly evolving into a driving force for local agriculture, bringing benefits throughout the supply chain. Recognizing this, we've chosen to source the vast majority of our coffee beans from dedicated micro-roasters scattered around the Siem Reap area. These passionate artisans offer incredibly high-quality products daily, demonstrating an attention to detail often lost in larger-scale operations.

We collaborate closely with these roasters to develop our unique house blends. These blends aren't static; they will be refreshed frequently, creating a natural rotation in our offerings. This approach not only keeps things exciting for you but also ensures we distribute our support equitably among our roasting partners.

## Passion Meets Precision

The Amara's founder brings a deep-seated passion for specialty coffee, honed during a year and a half working in a roastery in Italy. This background informs every step of our coffee program. It makes the process of selecting varieties, co-creating blends with our roasters, and perfecting the extraction both easier, thanks to experience, and, ironically, much harder, due to our uncompromising standards.

Our menu caters to diverse tastes, featuring classic coffee variations served hot or cold, with or without milk. We also offer refreshing Cold Brew and meticulously prepared V60 pour-overs. Please don't hesitate to ask our knowledgeable staff about the blends of the month – they'll be delighted to describe the unique characteristics of what you're about to enjoy.

## Sustainability as Standard

We firmly believe that sustainable choices shouldn't be premium privileges. At The Amara, every milk-based beverage can be prepared with one of our house-made plant-based milks at **no extra charge**. It's a small step towards making environmentally conscious options accessible to everyone.

## The Heart of Our Coffee: The Manual Lever Machine

Now, for the centrepiece – something you likely noticed the moment you walked in: our beautiful manual lever espresso machine. This isn't just for show; it's key to unlocking the full potential of our carefully sourced beans.

Extraction is an art form here. Our skilled baristas heat the water to the ideal temperature for each specific blend. They then manually control the extraction pressure, adjusting it precisely based on the coffee's characteristics. But the control doesn't stop there. The water we use is carefully adjusted for pH and alkalinity, and the beans are ground fresh, with the grind size dialled in according to the unique qualities of the coffee being served.

This meticulous attention to every single detail – from bean origin to water chemistry to extraction dynamics – allows us to offer you a coffee experience of superior quality, often at a price lower than what you might be accustomed to.

There's only one thing left to do.

You just have to try it.
